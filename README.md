# SVG-logo-maker

The SVG Logo Generator is a Node.js application that allows users to create custom SVG logos by providing text, text color, shape, and shape color options. It is a simple command-line tool that generates an SVG file containing the logo based on the user's input.

## Requirements

To run the SVG Logo Generator, you need to have Node.js installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.

3. Run the following command to start the SVG Logo Generator:

   ```
   node logoGenerator.js
   ```

4. The application will prompt you to enter the following information:

   - Text: Enter up to three characters for the logo.
   - Text Color: Enter the text color in a keyword format (e.g., 'red') or a hexadecimal number format (e.g., '#FF0000').
   - Shape: Choose a shape from 'circle', 'triangle', or 'square'.
   - Shape Color: Enter the shape color in a keyword format or a hexadecimal number format.
   - SVG Width (Optional): Enter the desired width of the SVG (default: 300).
   - SVG Height (Optional): Enter the desired height of the SVG (default: 200).

5. After providing all the required information, the application will generate an SVG file named `logo.svg` in the same directory.

## Default Values

If you do not provide values for the SVG width and height, the application will use the following default values:

- Default SVG Width: 300
- Default SVG Height: 200

## Notes

- The SVG Logo Generator will only accept valid shapes ('circle', 'triangle', or 'square'). If an invalid shape is provided, the application will display an error message and exit.

- If any errors occur during the process, the application will display an error message and terminate.
